FOOTYLIVELINESS - COMPLETE METRIC COMPARISON REPORT
================================================================================

DATASET:
  Train: Rounds 5-28 (240 matches)
  Val:   Rounds 29-33 (50 matches)
  Test:  Rounds 34-37 (40 matches)

METRICS TESTED:
  1. SLS-F+ Rolling: z-scores from rounds 0 to K-1 (no leakage)
     Formula: xG(50%) + SoT(20%) + BigCh(10%) + Corners(10%) + ToB(10%)
  2. SLS-F+ Fixed: z-scores from entire season (has leakage)
     Formula: Same as rolling but fixed normalization
  3. Liveliness xG: xG_total + min(xG_home, xG_away) (simple, interpretable)
