    "### Intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From a bit of observation using the browser developer tools, we realise that whenever we look at a specific match's page or statistics, Fotmob will query (via api) the data from the backend and that is returned by a json, that is then parsed to pass the statistics on to the UI. (See this from inspecting the network tab)\n",
    "2. What we need is that json file and in our case, we need to do it for all 380 matches that took place in the 24-25 season. \n",
    "3. Therefore, the next logical question is whether we can intercept the data json file as it is being passed to the frontend. We can using selenium-wire. The flow is like this: \n",
    "    - We go to the fotmob page with all the rounds matches (38 rounds).\n",
    "    - From this page we can pull the links for each specific match from that round by targeting the div classes and the anchor classes.\n",
    "    - Then from here we visit all of these match links and intercept the data json file that has been requested from the backend using there private API.\n",
    "    - In a few cases, you'll find that there was no data file saved, because the page probably took too long to load, this is okay and as long as it's one or two files, you can go to the browser yourself and pull that json file from the network tab and add it to your directory. \n",
    "4. This json file has all of the data and metadata needed for each match (including the prevailing weather conditions) so we simply save it and can process the parts that we need later on.\n",
    "5. Having tried querying the fotmob API directly through the browser, we see that it is pretty much locked (good programming practice) so we simply take the long route. "
